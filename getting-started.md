### Opening mdEditor

* mdEditor is currently hosted on the GitHub website and can be opened by following this URL: [https://jlblcc.github.io/mdEditor/\#/dashboard](https://jlblcc.github.io/mdEditor/#/dashboard)

* _Chrome_ is the recommended web browser for using mdEditor. The editor will work in other browsers, but has been fully tested in Chrome.
