# Starting Up mdEditor

---

Now that you have learned about the [mdJSON](https://mdtools.adiwg.org) format used by mdEditor and how mdEditor manages its files on your computer, let's start up mdEditor. Oh, if you skipped that section and don't know about these things it might be best to back up and read [Before We Begin](before-we-begin.md) _before we begin_.

### 1. Open an Internet Browser

You may use the recent version of most any internet browser that supports [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) such as [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), or [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge).  Although we have only thoroughly tested mdEditor with Chrome at this time we don't think your should have a problem with any of the others.

### 2. Browse to mdEditor home page

Open your browser and point it to [https://www.mdEditor.org](https://www.mdEditor.org). This will bring you to the mdEditor home page shown below. The home page offers a brief orientation to mdEditor as well as links to important supporting resources and other propaganda; and most importantly, a link to load mdEditor.  Click the big green button labeled <span class="btn btn-success">Try mdEditor now</span>.

### 3. Open mdEditor

You should now see the Dashboard of mdEditor.  This is the starting point in mdEditor for launching all tasks.  This is where you will start from each time you launch mdEditor.  What you actually see could look differently depending on your choice of browser and device.  Since mdEditor is smart enough to reconfigure the display based on available visual space, it will appear quiet differently on your mobile device than on your large work place monitor.  However, don't take this as a recommendation to edit metadata from your mobile phone.

Notice that the left sidebar lists the metadata records, contacts, and data dictionaries currently loaded into your browser cache.  These will be _your_ records and so will be different from those pictured in the screen shot.

As a shortcut, the next time you connect to mdEditor you can save a step and bypass the mdEditor home page by going directly to the mdEditor Dashboard at [https://go.mdeditor.org](https://go.mdeditor.org).

Now, let's create a first metadata record together!

{% hint style='info' %}
When you open mdEditor you may see an alert message telling you the software has changed since your last use and point to new features that may be available.  The message will not interfere with your editing.  Just read the message, close it, and continue.
{% endhint %}
