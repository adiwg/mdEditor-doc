# File Management

mdEditor.json files can be exported and imported via mdEditor's built in **Export** and **Import **functionality \(described in the [Export](/export.md) and [Import](/import.md) section of this manual\).

> **Note**: The only way to backup your records is by using the Export functionality. It is recommended that you use the Export functionality frequently to a local computer folder of your choosing. It is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor's **Clear Storage Cache **functionality.

In order to keep file size manageable, it is recommended that users work on, and then export one project \(and its related products and contacts\) at a time.
