### Troubleshooting Issues

Before you publish anything, click F12 \(Cmd + Opt + J on Mac\) to bring up the error console. Click on the three vertical dots for options on how to dock it.

1. The **Network tab** will show errors in Publishing when working with ScienceBase.
2. Click on the name of the row with errors and it will bring up a window - look at the **Preview Tab** to see the string of the error message.
3. Look for anything that appears red. If you see an error that is 400 and red, it’s a problem that you can address. However, If it’s a 500 level error in red, that is a ScienceBase error that is outside the scope of the mdEditor.
4. Any unsolvable issues can be submitted on the issues page for mdEditor: [https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues ](https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues)
