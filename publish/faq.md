1. Is moving the record in the mdEditor outline also moving the record in ScienceBase, or just overwriting the existing record?

   > Moving a record in mdEditor will overwrite the record in ScienceBase. If you have a record in ScienceBase already, then it is not advisable to move items in the publishing outline structure.
   >
   > If you want to move the item on ScienceBase via mdEditor, then edit the parent identifier in the record located in Metadata-&gt;Parent Metadata-&gt;Identifier.

2. If I have a product on ScienceBase already, one or more intermediate organizing folders, and then make an association to a project in mdEditor, will the product record go back to the same place?

   > It will go back to the exact same place as long as you don't change the parent ID in the metadata record itself or drag it around in the publishing outline.

3. Do I need to use mdEditor for updating items once I have uploaded to ScienceBase.

   > Once you use mdEditor for editing items, you have to keep using mdEditor. If you go back to DEPTH or ScienceBase directly to edit items, your edits will not be reflected in the attached mdJSON, so your edits will be lost \(overwritten\) the next time you publish from mdEditor.

4. What happens if a user works on files remotely, or more than one person works on the same project/product? Will these merge?

   > Files and contact lists will not merge. The new import will overwrite the older version. **Best Practice**: Maintain a master contacts list that is accessible by multiple editors. It is recommend that only one person edit the same project/product at the same time to help with version control.

5. What file format are ScienceBase files that are published from mdEditor?

   > ScienceBase files are 19115-2 iso files.
