The export function will allow the contents of the current metadata recordset to be saved as a mdEditor or a mdJSON file. The files can then be shared with collaborators and imported into another record set, imported into another browser using mdEditor, or saved to a local workstation as a backup or archival copy. Files are automatically named as “mdeditor-timestamp.json”.

> **Note:** mdJSON files can be uploaded and translated to other formats via the mdTranslator application while mdEditor files are exclusive to the mdEditor application and retain all mdEditor information, including settings.

> **Best Practice**: For a complete backup, use the **Export All **button. This exports an mdEditor file containing all records and contacts.
>
> **Best Practice:** Click** Export All** each time you finish a work session in mdEditor \(or switch browsers, URLs, etc.\).

### Export Action Menu

While importing data, there are four options available in the Action Menu \(on the right side of the export data window\).

* **Export All:** will export everything currently loaded in mdEditor into a single file. Exports an mdEditor JSON file.

* **Export Selected:** will only export the items you have selected \(so individual records, contacts, etc.\). If nothing is selected it will be disabled \(i.e., grayed out\). Exports an mdEditor JSON file.

* **Export mdJSON: ** only works for metadata records \(i.e., doesn't work for contacts\). Exports just the mdJSON file, which is a standalone JSON file you can load into mdTranslator and have translated into other metadata formats. mdJSON files imported into mdEditor are treated as new records and will not merge/update an existing record.

* Clicking the **Include Settings **switch will also export mdEditor settings. Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) section of this manual to learn about settings.

### General Notes on Exporting

> ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)**Best Practice: **When Exporting Contacts, it is recommended that you export all contacts together. If you load a project and the contacts aren’t loaded in mdEditor, you can’t inject the contacts back into the metadata record.
