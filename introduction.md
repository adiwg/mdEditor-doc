### Metadata Editor (mdEditor)
mdEditor (metadata Editor) is an application that assists users in authoring and editing metadata for research projects, datasets, maps, images, and other documents. The main goal of mdEditor is to hide much of technical complexity involved in creating archival quality metadata records in standards published by ISO (International Standards Organization) and FGDC (Federal Geographic Data Committee.

With mdEditor you can published metadata in any or all of its supported standards without specific knowledge of the standard.  mdEditor edits and saves all your metadata on your personal computer so there are no user IDs, passwords, or fees.  And your information is always private and secure. All that is required is an internet connection to load the most current version of mdEditor into your favorite internet browser to begin authoring and publishing metadata. 

mdEditor works hard to conceal the complexity of computer software and metadata standards to allow metadata authors to focus on their metadata content. Even with the assistance of mdEditor, archival quality metadata requires metadata authors to know their projects and datasets thoroughly and take the time necessary to describe them adequately. We hope you find that mdEditor will ease that task. And once entered mdEditor can generate metadata in the standard of your choice with a single button click. Have fun!
