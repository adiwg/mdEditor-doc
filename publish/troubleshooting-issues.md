The **Network tab** will show errors in Publishing when working with ScienceBase.

Look for anything that shows up in red. If you get anything 400 and red, it’s a problem that you can address. However, If it’s a 500 level error in red that is a Science Base problem that is outside the scope of the mdEditor.

* Click on the name of the row with errors and it will bring up a window - look at the Preview tab to see the string of the error message.
