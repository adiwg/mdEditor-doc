# File Management

mdEditor.json files can be exported and imported via mdEditor's built in **Export** and **Import **functionality \(described in the [Export](/export.md) and [Import](/import.md) section of this manual\).

### File Management Notes and Best Practices

---

#### General Workflow:

#### ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)

* **Best practice: Work on project-by-project basis.**

  * In order to keep file size manageable, it is recommended that you work on, and then export one project \(and its related products and contacts\) at a time. You should group said project, products, and contacts together using the same scheme that your organization uses to organize data.
  * _Save each project and affiliated products together** as a set**_**.** To do this, select “Export” from the top menu, select the appropriate records \(i.e., the target project and its affiliated products\), and then click “Export Selected.” Consult the [**Export**](/export.md)** **section of this manual to learn more about export functionality.
  * Save the resulting mdEditor JSON file to your hard drive in a working folder. There should be a separate mdEditor JSON file for each project and all of its products. 
  * When exporting projects and products, export all of your contacts. 

* **Best Practice**: Leave your dictionaries in mdEditor all the time so they’re always available.

* **Best Practice**: Leave your contacts in mdEditor all the time so they’re always available.

* **Best Practice**: Set up a metadata directory so you can always find metadata files. This directory will typically be a folder on your local machine that is easily found and accessible.

* **Best Practice:** Maintain an “Export All” JSON file each time you finish a work session in mdEditor \(or switch browsers, URLs, etc.\).

### Exporting:

* **Note: **The only way to backup your records is by using the [Export](/export.md) functionality.

* **Best Practice**: When exporting projects and products, export all of your contacts.

* **Best Practice**: It is recommended that you use the [Export](/export.md) functionality frequently to a local computer folder of your choosing. It is particularly important that you export your records for backup before using mdEditor's **Clear Storage Cache **functionality \(clearing the storage cache will delete any records or data you have entered into the mdEditor\). Consult the [Settings](/settings.md) section of this manual to learn more.

### mdEditor Contacts:

### ![](/assets/best_practice_small.png)

* **Best Practice**: Export all contacts together \(unless you’re comfortable knowing exactly which contacts are used in your record set\), otherwise if you load a project and the contacts aren’t loaded in mdEditor, you can’t inject the contacts back into the metadata record.
* **Best Practice**: Save mdEditor contacts at the end of every work session, load before each work session and ensure they are up-to-date. Then load the project/product record you want to work on.
* **Best Practice**: Leave your contacts in mdEditor all the time so they’re always available.
